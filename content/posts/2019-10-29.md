Today, JavaScript is not only popular, it is universal. JavaScript is a strategically important skill. You can use JavaScript to create web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, command line utilities, and control IoT devices. You can build "serverless" functions. It is the scripting language of choice for countless applications - even Microsoft Excel has a new JavaScript API!

It works on the server with nodejs, it has been working on browsers since 1995, it works on the Internet Of Things Devices, it is used to create native performance applications, it is used to make cross-platform desktop applications, it is used to power intelligent televisions, you can create music with it, you can create the next generative art of the century using it. I guess these are enough reasons why one should learn JavaScript. In short, it's literally everywhere!

## What will you learn in this course?

You will learn JavaScript from zero to an advanced level, using advanced features such as classes, constants, functions and inheritances. Upgrade to ECMAScript 6 as const, let, classes, super, inheritance and arrow pointer functions. We'll create three projects where we'll practice everything we've learned. Don't wait any longer and learn the only language where you can program from Backend to Fronted.
