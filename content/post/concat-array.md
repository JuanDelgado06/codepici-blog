There are a few ways to concatenate arrays in JavaScript.
## Array.concat
We can all `Array.concat` on an array to combine 2 arrays and return the new one. For example:
```
const a = [1,2,3];
const b = [4,5];
const c = a.concat(b) // [1,2,3,4,5]
```
## Array.push
We can push elements of one array into another.
```
const a = [1,2,3];
const b = [4,5];
let c = Object.assign([], a);
for (let i = 0; i < b.length; i++){
  c.push(b[i]);
}
console.log(c); // [1,2,3,4,5]
```
What we did is make a copy of `a` and assigned it to `c` , then pushed the elements of `b` by looping through it and adding them to the end of `c` .
## Spread Operator
With ES6 or later, we can use the spread operator to spread the items from another array into a new array by doing the following:
```
const a = [1,2,3];
const b = [4,5];
const c = [...a, ...b];
console.log(c); // [1,2,3,4,5]
```
