There are a few ways to repeat a string in JavaScript. JavaScript strings have a built in `repeat()` function. You can also use a loop to do the same thing.
## String.repeat Function
To use the `repeat` function, you pass in the number of times you want to repeat the string as an argument. It returns a new string
For example:
```
const hello = "hello";
const hello5 = A.repeat(5);
console.log(hello5); // "hellohellohellohellohello"
```
## Use a loop
You can use `for` loop and `while` loop to do repeatedly concatenate strings.
Using a `for` loop, you can do:
```
const hello = "hello";
```
With a `while` loop, you can do:
```
const hello = "hello";
```
They both involve increment indexes up to the maximum.
