There are 2 ways to get the length of the list of keys of an object.
## Object.keys
`Object.keys` gets the top level list of keys of an object and returns an array of them. For example:
```
const a = {foo: 1, bar: 2};
const length = Object.keys(a).length // 2
```
## Object.getPropertyNames
`Object.getPropertyNames` also gets a list of all top level of keys of an object and return them as an array. For example:
```
const a = {foo: 1, bar: 2};
const length = Object.`getOwnPropertyNames`(a).length // 2
```
## forâ€¦in Loop
There is a special loop for looping through the keys of an object. You can do the following:
```
const a = {foo: 1, bar: 2};
let keysCount = 0;
for (let key in a) {
    keysCount++;
}
console.log(`keysCount) // 2
```
